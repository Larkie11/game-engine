Things done-
Collision between player's monsters and tower's monsters (Animation, attacking done) with physics
Shop - read from text to display what player can purchase (Scrollable according to how many items in the shop text file)
1 database - holds all the available monsters stats (AnimationSprite name, tooltip for shop description, (Going to implement: tooltip for in-game), number of sprites, size of sprite, etc)
Main menu
Mouse collision touch with buttons 
Animation manager


To Be Done -
Inventory - add in to inventory when buy from shop, maybe add button on main menu to change between what monsters player wants to use in game
Audio is not even playing anymore (Fix it please)
Adding more gameplay features (up to you all)
Maybe add different kind of enemies (Like shooting fire ball (Ownself add collision for those thanks (Use distance checking to shoot bullet, then use physics for monster and bullet collision))
Gacha Feature?? (Random a monster and add in to inventory, special event monsters not available in shops?)
Upgrade system (Upgrade tower (Health or ulti, etc)) - Allow player to upgrade from menu (Add a button for it)

Can be done
Bosses?
Particle System?
